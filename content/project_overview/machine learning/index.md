Machine learning and data-driven models rely on patterns in the data to answer research questions, as compared to relying on researcher-generated hypotheses. These data-driven models show great promise in helping the field predict very difficult-to-predict outcomes, like eating disorder severity and suicide.

**Example questions I tackle within this area include:**
1. How can we best define eating disorder severity?
2. Does a better definition of eating disorder severity relate to or improve treatment outcomes?
3. How can we better predict eating disorder treatment outcomes?

**Example papers within this content area include, but are not limited to:**

**Forrest, L. N.**, Jacobucci, R. C., & Grilo, C. M. (2022). Empirically determined severity levels for binge-eating disorder outperform existing severity classification schemes. *Psychological Medicine, 52*, 685–695.
